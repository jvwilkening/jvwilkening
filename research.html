						<h2>Research Interests</h2>
						<p>I am broadly interested in the physical and biological interactions that drive environmental processes in the Earth's critical zone. This has led me to pursue a variety of research questions that sit at the intersection of hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry. My PhD work focuses on how different stressors, such as disease, drought, and fire, impact plant-water interactions. I study this using a combination of models, experiments, and field work. I particularly focus on how the findings can improve our understanding of both the mechanisms driving these interactions, as well as avenues for improving management of these systems. See below for more information on some of these more recent questions I've been working on.</p>

						<h3>Coordination of Plant Physiology and Water Uptake Patterns</h3>
                        <p><span class="image right" style="font-size:75%;line-height:125%;"><img src="images/greenhouse.jpg" style="width:220px;margin-right:20px;"/><caption><i>Populus trichocarpa</i> trees being grown <br>for the experiment (Image: JV Wilkening)</caption></span>I am currently working on a project to better understand how changes in plant water status and stomatal control are coordinated with water uptake and partitioning in the subsurface as plants become more water stressed. To do this, I am conducting experiments in a greenhouse using both physiological measurements and stable isotope tracers to understand plant function and water fluxes. Stay tuned for results!</p>

                                <h3>Landscape Rehabilitation in Arid Ecosystems</h3>
                                <p><span class="image left" style="font-size:75%;line-height:125%;"><img src="images/ET_cover.png" style="width:360px;margin-right:20px;"/><caption>Plants grown on an engineered soil cover at a site in Western Australia as part of experiment <br>from which data were used to validate model (Image: Sebastian Lamoureux)</caption></span>Evapotranspiration (ET) covers, which consist of an engineered soil layer supporting vegetation, are an increasingly popular rehabilitation tool for former mining and landfill sites. They take advantage of plant water uptake to manage the water balance in the soil cover, limiting deep drainage that could potentially mobilize contaminants and waste products from the prior site operations. However, in arid ecosystems there is the potential that the plant water uptake could be hydraulically limited, possibly increasing the risk of contaminant mobilization and mortality of the vegetation. In this work, I am using a stochastically-driven plant hydraulic model to optimize the design of these systems while accounting for hydraulic limitation and variable climatic conditions. Initial results from this work were presented at the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFM.H12H..03W/abstract">AGU 2019 Fall Meeting</a> (slides available <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qZihzVBkq_AX1AbQT5f_KiYmezDAfFxO">here</a>) and a manuscript is currently in preparation. </p>

								<h3>Hydrologic Mechanisms of Plant Pathogen Spread</h3>
								<p><span class="image right" style="font-size:75%;line-height:125%;"><img src="images/pc_output.jpeg" style="width:450px;margin-right:20px;"/><caption>Model output showing predicted pathogen spread (light blue shading) from initial observed <br>patches (light blue line) when accounting for overland transport (left) and without overland <br>transport (right) as compared to observed spread patterns (dark blue line)</caption></span>I developed a model to predict the biological growth and transport of the plant pathogen <i>Phytophthora cinnamomi</i> at the landscape scale. Using this model and case studies of disease progression in Western Australia and Spain, I investigated the role of overland runoff as a spread mechanism and how simple hydrological analysis can be used to create more quantitative and spatially-explicit management strategies for disease containment. Model code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/jvwilkening/Pc_Spread_Model">Github Page</a> and forcing data is available on <a href="https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/a010a9c248284240a44180d339a2cba2/">Hydroshare</a>.</p>

								<h3>Biogeochemical Cycling in Salt Marshes</h3>

As part of this work, I looked at seasonal dynamics of biogeochemical cycling and this work was published in coordination with other work from the Turchyn lab in early 2019. I also studied differences in the formation of volatile organosulfur compound formation between sulfidic and ferruginous sedimentary environments and this work was published in late 2019.</p>
